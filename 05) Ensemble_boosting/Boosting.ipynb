    "## Boosting\n",
    "Boosting is an ensemble approach(meaning it involves several trees) that starts from a weaker decision and keeps on building the models such that the final prediction is the weighted sum of all the weaker decision-makers.\n",
    "The weights are assigned based on the performance of an individual tree.\n",
    "The main idea of boosting is to train weak learners sequentially, each trying to correct its predecessor\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src= \"Image/boosting_basic.PNG\">\n",
    "\n",

    "Ensemble parameters are calculated in **stagewise way** which means that while calculating the subsequent weight, the learning from the previous tree is considered as well.\n"

    "## Adaboost Explanation\n",
    "- Adaboost combines multiple weak learners into a single strong learner. \n",
    "- It will create different decision trees with a single split (one depth), called decision stumps. \n",
    "- The number of decision stumps it will make will depend on the number of features in the dataset. Suppose there are M features then, Adaboost will create M  decision stumps. \n",
    " 1. We will assign an equal sample weight to each observation. \n",
    " 2. We will create M decision stumps, for M number of features.\n",
    " 3. Out of all M decision stumps, I first have to select one best decision tree model. For selecting it, we will either calculate the Entropy or Gini coefficient. The model with lesser entropy will be selected (means model that is less disordered).\n",
    " 4. Now, after the first decision stump is built, an algorithm would be train on randomly select record from Dataset and then Prediction is made on whole dataset and check how many observations the model has misclassified.\n",
    " 5. Suppose out of N observations, The first decision stump (Weak/base learner) has misclassified T number of observations.\n",
    " 6. For this, we will calculate the total error (TE), \n",
    "                          Total Error (T.E) = T/N.\n",
    " 7. Now we will calculate the performance of the first decision stump.\n",
    "                          Performance of stump = 1/2*loge((1-TE)/TE)\n",
    " 8. Now we will update the weights assigned before. To do this, we will first update the weights of those observations, which we have misclassified. The weights of wrongly classified observations will be increased and the weights of correctly classified weights will be reduced.\n",
    " 9. By using this formula: \n",
    "                           Incorrect Classified record weigths:- [old weight * (e^performance of stump)]\n",
    "                           Correct Classified Record Weigths :- [old weight * (e^-(performance of stump))]\n",
    " 10. Now respectively for each observation, we will add and subtract the updated weights to get the final weights. \n",
    " 11. But these weights are not normalized that is their sum is not equal to one. To do this, we will sum them and divide each final weight with that sum. \n",
    " 12. After this, we have to make our second decision stump. For this, we will make a class intervals for the normalized weights.\n",
    " 13. After that, we want to make a second weak model. But to do that, we need a sample dataset on which the second weak model can be run. For making it, we will run N number of iterations. On each iteration, it will calculate a random number ranging between 0-1 and this random will be compared with class intervals we created and on which class interval it lies, that row will be selected for sample data set. So new sample data set would also be of N observation. \n",
    " 14. This whole process will continue for M decision stumps. The final sequential tree would be considered as the final tree."

    "\n",

    "4) **Missing Values**: XGBoost is designed to handle missing values internally. The missing values are treated in such a manner that if there exists any trend in missing values, it is captured by the XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Flexibility**: In addition to regression, classification, and ranking problems, it supports user-defined objective functions also. An objective function is used to measure the performance of the model given a certain set of parameters. Furthermore, it supports user defined evaluation metrics as well.\n",

    "6) **Availability**: Currently, it is available for programming languages such as R, Python, Java, Julia, and Scala.\n",

    "7) **Save and Reload**: XGBoost gives us a feature to save our data matrix and model and reload it later. Suppose, we have a large data set, we can simply save the model and use it in future instead of wasting time redoing the computation.\n",
    "\n",
